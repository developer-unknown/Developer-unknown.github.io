## HTML Tutorial

Welcome to the HTML programming tutorial.
After this article, you will be a pro at HTML. So let's start!

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### First of all, what is HTML?

Well, HTML is a language that is used to build webpages.
With HTML, you can create interactive buttons, different fonts of text, and you can style webpages with a secondary language called CSS.
It is a very easy langauge to learn.

### Writing HTML

Here, we'll show you some HTML commands that you can
try:

```markdown
Create a new text file and put the following code in
it, the, save it as an HTML file then open it with your browser.

<h1>Click the button</h1>
<br>
<button>Click Me</button>
```
You probably got big text that says "Click the button"
and an actual button. However, the button doesn't do anything.
Let's make it interactive.

```markdown
<h1>Click the button</h1>
<br>
<button onclick="alert ('Your have clicked the button')">Click Me</button>
```
### Guess the code!

Here, you will guess what the HTML code does. NO CHEATING!
Here we go:

```markdown
Guess what it does (Your not expected to know this as a beginner)

<h2>Complete the given task below</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p>Task: Click the button</p>
<button onclick="alert ('Great job completing the task')">CLICK ME</button>
```

Did you get it?

What the code did was display the text "Complete the given task below"
and displayed a paragraph at the botton (using the <p> command) that said "Task: Click the button".
Then, when you clicked the button that showed "Click me", it would alert you and say "Great job completing the task".
  
### List of HTML commands and what they mean

```markdown
<h1></h1> | Displays big text like a title
<title></title> | Displays a title for the current tab
<p></p> | Displays a paragraph
<br> | Places a line break
<button></button> | Displays a button
alert ('') | Alerts you with a message
```
